# RockPaperScissors

A simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Player One and Two have arrays with the selection of Rock, Paper, and Scissors as strings inside the array.

The rand() function in C++ is used to pick a random number to modulate by 3 as the result represents what Player One and Two will pick.

Then, as you run the program, Player One and Two will pick their option and shoot their object as strings.

The program decides who wins based on the Player's selection (i.e Player One picks Rock, Player Two picks Paper => Player Two wins)

If both players pick the same object, the program will declare it as a tie.
